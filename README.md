# Summer-Internship
This repository is for all the files I worked when i was an undergraduate Student Researcher at NDSU. 
All of these files work but suggest working with AnalyzeVideo.py and RecordVivdeo.py only.
RecordVideo.py is for Raspberry Pi. It must be run inside Rasbperry Pi for it to work.
Use a USB stick for to store any recored video.
AnalyzeVideo.py and recorded video must be put in the same directory so that analyzeVideo can actually output.
